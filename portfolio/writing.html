           <h3>The terrifying comparison between Hulu’s ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’ and Trump’s America</h3>
           <p>The hit Hulu series ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’ based on Margaret Atwood’s dystopian novel scarily mimics the political climate America is currently experiencing. The show tells the story of women forced to be “handmaids”, or sex-slave-child-bearers, for America’s white and wealthy males due to widespread infertility across the country. There is no such thing as abortion and men have all the power. Handmaids are not permitted to resist their Commanders nor the government in any way.</p>

           <p>Similar to the Right-wing conservative government in ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’, our current government is comprised of primarily older, white conservatives and controlled by a president who does not prioritize diversity within the government. But, the greatest similarity between the dystopian novel and our current government rests in the lack of reproductive rights for women.</p>

           <p>‘The Handmaid’s Tale’ creepily echoes this theme throughout the series. Handmaids have no choice whether or not they want to have children and are forced to carry the baby to term. With strict abortion laws in America today, women in some states are forced to carry their babies to term because of these male-imposed restrictions that exist. States including Arizona, Arkansas, Texas, and Iowa have created extreme limitations to reproductive rights making it almost impossible to get an abortion.</p>

           <p>Frankly, our country has a gender equality issue. Men are consistently held to higher standards than women and tasked with greater, more important decisions. ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’ should serve as a reminder for what could happen if women are not treated as equal to their male counterparts. </p>

          <h3> University of Miami’s new Student Housing Village underway </h3>
          <p>Due to open Phase 1 in Fall 2019, the new Student Housing Village on the University of Miami campus has been an ongoing construction project since early Fall 2017. The plans for the project were approved in May 2017 and have since allowed for clearing of the site. Predicted to need about 600,000 square feet, the elaborate plans feature 25 buildings catering to the living needs of both underclassmen and upperclassmen.</p>

	        <p> The new Student Housing Village is already underway, as the foundations for the site are being laid in the next three weeks, according to project manager Michael Gonzalez.  While the facility is currently eight acres of cleared land, the vast space on the southeast side of Lake Osceola between the Merrick Garage and Eaton Residential College will house a Freshman Village and housing for upperclassmen.</p>

          <p>The school “just received initial permits to begin [building] in the next week or two,” said Mike Piacentino, the marketing specialist for the University of Miami Department of Housing and Residential Life on Monday. “We are bringing in some rebar and concrete in a few days,” Piacentino said, “students should begin to see some real building and structures will be visible”. According to Piacentino, the barren land sitting on the corner of the lake will be built up in some time. He said that “by August 2019, the Freshman Village will be ready for residents,” although the other phases of the project may take more time.</p>

          <p>Despite the many positives to this $193 million dollar project, the time and space needed for this kind of construction creates several obstacles. On January 14, the 67th Beaux Arts Festival was held on the University of Miami campus on the Foote Greene directly outside Richter Library. This year, the art festival had to be moved from its previous location on the green where the Student Housing Village is being constructed. The changing of locations created a ripple in obstacles for the university on that January day including the changing of locations of the University of Miami Panhellenic Association’s Bid Day rituals. The project manager for the construction suggests that structural obstacles had to be fixed as well.</p>

          <p>“Moss & Associates has been chosen as the general contractor for the job,” said Michael Gonzalez, the project manager from Moss & Associates Construction Management. “Relocating utilities on site has been the most time consuming aspect of the process,” said Gonzalez on Tuesday. Gonzalez stated that “the previous buildings and underground utilities had to be demolished before any future work can begin.” “300 trees had to be removed from the site,” said Gonzalez, explaining the barren land that is currently at the worksite. “Utilities had to be abandoned beyond site limits in order to move forward with the construction,” he said.</p>

          <p>According to Gonzalez, 100 trees were preserved and moved to other locations on campus, while the others were moved to a temporary off-campus site. “The tree relocations are currently being finalized,” said Gonzalez. He also said that in the upcoming months, “students living in Eaton Residential College will hear a lot of noise.” “They may want to study somewhere else other than their dorm rooms,” Gonzalez said.</p>

          <p>Alexa Davis, a creative advertising major at the University of Miami and a current resident of Eaton Residential College said, “I look forward to seeing what is to come in the upcoming weeks”. Davis said that she feels, “tired of looking at an empty worksite for months now. [She] wants to see some actual progress”. There is much anticipation for current freshmen about what the new Student Housing Village could mean for them in their junior or senior years. “I never considered living on campus as an upperclassman, but these plans actually make me feel like I might,” Davis said.</p>

          <p>She was informed by the Student Affairs New Student Housing webpage of the plans for the new Student Housing Village. Davis said that she is, “nervous about the kind of impact the construction noise will have on [her] studies”. She expressed concern of not being able to focus with the construction. With real building starting in the upcoming weeks, students and faculty will soon see the result of the planning and extensive site-work that occurred in the past few months.</p>

          <h3> University of Miami’s new Student Housing Village underway </h3>
          <p>The American Dream Meadowlands construction project in East Rutherford, NJ, which began construction in 2004, is finally set to open in March 2019 after years of struggling to find funding.</p>

          <p>The $5 billion project will be home to hundreds of different attractions including high-fashion retail stores, a Cirque-Du-Solei theater, an aquarium, an ice rink, an indoor ski slope, a Nickelodeon-themed amusement park, a LegoLand Discovery Center, a waterpark and much more, according to the official website of the American Dream. It sits directly next to the MetLife Stadium – the home to the New York Giants.</p>

          <p>It will be not just a megamall, but a global tourist attraction, according to the Triple Five Group, the contracting company for the project. Don Ghermezian, the president of Triple Five said in a statement that the project will, “create tens of thousands of jobs, bring millions of tourists and billions of dollars in economic growth annually to Bergen County and the state of New Jersey.”</p>

          <p>No structure of this caliber has ever been built in North America.</p>

	        <p>Despite the wide variety of entertainment that the project will host, the American Dream Meadowlands has not received all positive feedback. According to a member of the UniteHere union, who would like her identity to be kept confidential, “the quality of jobs is a big concern.”</p>

          <p>The UniteHere union represents about 300,000 people across the U.S. and Canada. They advocate for various kinds of workers, but primarily for hotel, casino and amusement park workers.</p>

          <p>The member, an advocate for labor and environmental justice, claims that “it will be hard to regulate so many low-wage jobs and ensure good conditions.”</p>

          <p>The member also shared that the Triple Five Group has recently acquired land in Broward County, Miami and will begin developing an American Dream Miami soon. One of her biggest concerns regarding the Miami project is the environmental aspect of it.</p>

          <p>“The project is located on 530,000 acres of wetlands,” she said. The member also said that, “the water from the wetlands goes into an aquifer which is the largest source of drinking water in Miami.”</p>

          <p>She expressed concern about what will happen to the aquifer when the project is constructed.</p>

          <p>Information on when the American Dream Miami is predicted to open is not available, as the project has not yet begun construction.</p>

          <p>Jim Kirkos, the President and CEO of the Meadowlands Regional Chamber of Commerce, does not believe that either project poses any serious environmental or job welfare concerns. He calls the American Dream Meadowlands a “major win for the region and the state of NJ.”</p>

          <p>Kirkos says that, “The American Dream project is an absolute game changer for the Greater Meadowlands economy.  It will be a dynamic entertainment and retail complex with an awesome wow factor that will enhance the existing assets at the sports complex consisting of MetLife Stadium, Meadowlands Racetrack, and Arena.” </p>

          <p>He says there will be “almost 20,000 jobs created between construction and operations and the economic impacts of the project which will make us a primary destination are enormous.”</p>

          <p>“The company building this project is the same one that owns and operates the Mall of America in Minnesota,” Kirkos says.  “Last year that facility generated 42 million visitors through its doors.”</p>

          <p>Kirkos believes, “the American Dream will beat those visitor counts and drive the regional economy by filling hotel rooms, restaurants, and attractions outside of it’s own entities within the project.” It is projected to be the largest mall in North America.</p>

          <p>Bailey Tocci, a longtime resident of East Rutherford, NJ, the hometown of the American Dream Meadowlands, says that she “has been seeing construction take place at the site for a long time” and is “anxious to see what is in store for New Jersey.”</p>

	        <p>The American Dream Meadowlands first began construction in 2004 under the name “Xanadu” by developers Mack-Cali and the Mills Corporation. The project was then acquired by several other developers before the Triple Five Group took control. They struggled with funding for years, but announced in June 2017, that JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs would complete financing for the project.</p>

          <p>The Meadowlands region sits on the border between the wetlands of New Jersey and the expressways to New York City.</p>

          <p>Lily Jacobson, an environmental advocate and a graduate from the University of Wisconsin-Madison environmental studies program in 2015, claims that “the impact that both American Dreams can have on wetlands is being underplayed by developers.”</p>

          <p>The wetlands that the American Dream Meadowlands is located on are the home to rain water that would flood the state elsewhere, according to officials of the environmental advocacy group, the Sierra Club.</p>

	        <p>Jacobson says that, “the traffic that both American Dreams will bring to their respective areas in Miami and New Jersey will surely release excess greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.”</p>

          <p>According to Jacobson, “with both structures located next to highways, it will be easy for people to check them out. More cars will mean more traffic and that will be especially bad for the already deteriorating ozone layer.” She believes that she represents environmentalists globally when she outwardly opposes these projects.</p>

          <p>The anticipated opening for the American Dream Meadowlands is gradually approaching, despite the environmental and job welfare controversy. There is no evidence of impact yet and until doors open in March 2019, the scale of the project will remain unknown.</p>

          <p>John Obeid, a senior real estate expert of the Tri-State area from Colliers International does not see any issue with the location of the American Dream Meadowlands. He says that, “The American Dream property is ideally situated, adjacent to MetLife stadium and at the intersection of the New Jersey Turnpike and Routes 3 and 17.”</p>

          <p>It is clear that commercialization is a main priority in the construction of this project. “The scale of the complex along with the shopping and entertainment experience will drive consumers and tourists to this location and make it a true retail destination for any person living within or traveling to the New Jersey or the Tri-state area,” says Obeid.</p>

          <p>The push for commercialization and the struggle for environmental and job welfare protection make the construction of the American Dream Meadowlands and the American Dream Miami very controversial. The upcoming years will be critical to see how the commercial sector can compromise with environmentalists and unions to ensure protection of the environment and the workers in these megamalls.</p>

          <h3>Florida’s 114th House District special election to take place May 1</h3>
          <p>On May 1, a special election will take place to fill the vacant seat for the Florida’s 114th House District.  The vacant seat has been filled by two different people since the district was redrawn in 2012. Both of the previous candidates have been found guilty of criminal charges.</p>

          <p>Currently, Republican Andrew Vargas and Democrat Javier Fernandez are campaigning to win the seat to represent Coral Gables, West Miami and some of Miami and Pinecrest.</p>

	        <p>Erik Fresen, a prior holder of the Statehouse Seat, pleaded guilty to tax evasion. Following that, Daisy Baez, the previous holder of the seat, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor perjury in November. Now, the people of the 114th House District anxiously scrutinize the two candidates that remain and wait to make their decision on May 1 for a solid and commendable representative.</p>

	        <p>Republican candidate Andrew Vargas is a law partner to Miami State Rep. Carlos Trujillo of Trujillo Vargas Gonzalez Hevia LLP. Vargas built his platform on family values and ethics – something that the community is seeking in its next candidate, according to Maria Gonzalez, a resident of the 114th district.</p>

          <p>Gonzalez claims that Vargas is the best candidate for this position because he “actually cares about the community.”</p>

          <p>When asked about what Vargas will do for the economy of the district, Gonzalez said that, “he will make the best decisions to help the economy thrive. He is a small business owner after all.”</p>

          <p>Vargas prides himself on being a small business owner and “employing more than 30 people,” according to his campaign website.</p>

          <p>Vargas’ spokesperson, Alexis Calatayud, said in a phone interview that, “if elected, Andrew’s goal is to be the voice of residents and the voice of rationality and sensible solutions that are not beholden to party lines.” Calatayud said that, “he will advocate for policies that increase quality of life for now and for the future – for children and grandchildren.”</p>

          <p>“He wants to his perspective to be that of solutions and he wants to do what is best not necessarily for one party, but for both,” Calatayud said.</p>

	        <p>Vargas already has the upper hand in this election that is now just a few weeks away, as the candidate with the most funding. He entered into 2018 with $154,000 donated from Trujillo. By the end of March, Vargas had $277,000 in campaign contributions.</p>

          <p>Fernandez’ financial standing in the campaign are less than that of Vargas’, despite that Fernandez began the campaign with more funding. Fernandez reportedly raised $78,510 in December, but was accused of improperly reporting expenses.</p>

          <p>Fernandez, similar to Vargas, prides much of his campaign on transparency and honesty following the scandals of the prior candidates. Fernandez accused Vargas of improperly reporting expenses in a statement issued in January, saying that, “it is ironic that my opponent's campaign, which seemingly prides itself on similar virtues, is receiving the continuous help from an organization that attacks my ethics while it flagrantly files false reports in order to hide the sources of its funding.”</p>

          <p>The organization to which Fernandez was referring is the People for a Progressive Florida. Calatayud opposed this accusation by saying, “he does not accept money from special interest groups, from developers, or people with specific agendas.”</p>

	        <p>Sofia Rodriguez, a long-time resident of the 114th District, believes that Fernandez is the better candidate for the seat. She said that she supports him because, “his stance on gun control is very promising.”</p>

          <p>Rodriguez claimed that, “stricter gun regulations have been needed in this country for a long time. Now, more than ever it is so obvious.” She also said that, “Fernandez’ push for tighter regulations could help stop the mass shootings.”</p>

          <p>Aside from tighter gun control regulations, Fernandez’ platform is also built on reforming the education system, building more affordable housing, protecting the environment, and expanding mass transportation.</p>

          <p>Alejandro Munoz-McKearney, a spokesperson for Fernandez, said in an email interview, that in regard to why he is running, Fernandez said, "I have dedicated my career to serving the community where I was born and where I am raising my family. For years, I have been an advocate for those without a voice. Now it is time to be an advocate for the residents of District 114. As the son of a 41-year veteran, Miami-Dade County Public School teacher, I firmly believe that access to quality, public education is fundamental to a dynamic economy and combating our community’s growing income inequality.”</p>

          <p>According to Munoz-McKearney, Fernandez went on to say, “I will be a voice in the Florida House for state action to address the growing threat of climate change and for sensible gun control."</p>

	        <p>Both Fernandez and Vargas are seeking to change House District 114 by lawfully and respectfully representing the people. Despite that Fernandez’ campaign pushes for more social reforms, while Vargas’ pushes for economic reforms, the biggest concern about who will take the seat rests in the integrity of the candidate.</p>

          <p>Sara Rosensweig, a political science major from the University of Massachusetts who graduated in 1990 and is now an attorney, said that “the electorate will pick the candidate most likely to best represent the people.” In this case, she said, “the electorate is most concerned with not electing a criminal above anything else.”</p>

          <p>The 114th House District is not heavily divided between parties, as the prior representative was a Democrat and the one before that was a Republican. The district voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Presidential Election. The next month will be “busy with campaigning,” according to Calatayud, until the May 1st election.</p>
